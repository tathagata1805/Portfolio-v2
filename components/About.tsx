        <p>
          I am a dedicated Software Engineer with 3 years of experience specializing in frontend development, and a passion for building dynamic, user-centric products. My journey began in my third year of college when I discovered the transformative power of web development â€” how a few lines of code could solve real-world problems. This led me to focus on frontend technologies, particularly React.js, and I proudly consider myself a self-taught developer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout my career, I have had the opportunity to work across diverse domains, from my initial internship at an Ed-Tech startup to freelancing for multiple clients. This variety has given me a solid foundation in both frontend and backend development, with extensive hands-on experience in JavaScript, TypeScript, React.js, Next.js, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, MUI, and Tailwind CSS.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am also proficient in backend technologies like Node.js, Express.js, SQL and NoSQL databases, and have practical knowledge of cloud platforms such as MS Azure and containerization tools like Docker.
        </p>
        <p>
          I thrive in dynamic environments, and my ability to adapt quickly to new technologies and methodologies has been a key factor in my growth. Whether it's learning a new tech stack or managing tight deadlines, I consistently deliver high-quality, scalable solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to my technical skills, I have demonstrated leadership and team management capabilities, having led product development across the entire SDLC during my freelance projects. I am now looking for new opportunities where I can continue to grow, apply my expertise, and contribute to building impactful, innovative products.
